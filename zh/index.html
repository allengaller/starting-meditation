        <h2 id="why">為什麼要冥想？</h2>
        <p>你不必練習冥想。</p>
        <p>但如果你像我一樣，你會發現自己經常感到焦慮。 你可能也很難處理分心。</p>
        <p>對於像你我這樣的人來說，沉思可以成為一種冷靜下來，更加專注，意識到的方式。 無論在工作上還是對待朋友和家人，這都是有益的。</p>
        <p>還有其他的方法來達到同樣的目標。 我冥想的原因是它是免費的，我幾乎可以在任何地方做到這一點，許多科學研究證明它是有效的。</p>
        <p>-</p>
        <p>現在, 沒有必要買佛像, 學會盤腿坐, 或長鬍子。冥想基本上只是坐著和呼吸。</p>

          <div class="large-7 columns">
            <h2 id="basic-technique">基本的技術</h2>
            <p>冥想是很簡單的。找到一個地方, 你可以不受干擾的課程, 並設置一個10分鐘的計時器。</p>
            <h3 id="posture">姿勢</h3>
            <p>坐直背。你可以坐在椅子上, 或在地板上, 或站起來。你也可以躺下, 但你可能會入睡。</p>
            <p>睜開眼睛和閉上眼睛都有好處。選擇你覺得最舒服的東西, 並在整個課程上堅持下去。</p>
            <h3 id="breathing">呼吸</h3>
            <p>你不必以任何特殊的呼吸方式去冥想。 有些人喜歡用幾個深呼吸來開始他們的課程。 其他人則會因為這樣做而更加焦慮。 我建議你先從正常的呼吸開始</p>
            <p>讓空氣通過你的鼻子進出。感覺你的胃在每次呼吸中膨脹和虛脫。注意你的胸部在上升和下降。</p>
            <h3 id="practice">The practice</h3>
            <p>The meditation practice consists of being aware of your breath, right now, in this moment. </p>
            <p>As soon as you notice that you are no longer aware of your breath, bring the breath back into your awareness.</p>
            <h3 id="distractions">Distractions</h3>
            <p>Various distractions will try to snag your attention away from the breath.</p>
            <p>The distractions will be both internal and external. External distractions might be sounds. Internal distractions might be thinking about the future.</p>
            <p>We can’t stop distraction from happening. The only thing we can do is to notice them, and come back to the breath.</p>
            <p>We need thinking for all intelligent activites. The problem is only when we think too much – when we ruminate on things that we could just as well let go of. Meditation is a good way to notice when you are ruminating, and learning to let go.</p>
            <p>–</p>
            <p>Posture, breathing, practice and distractions. This is all the technique you need to meditate.</p>

          <p>When you start out, it might be helpful to have some guidance for your meditation practice.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, there are a lot of great resources available for free online.</p>
          <p>You can download MP3s from <a href="http://marc.ucla.edu/body.cfm?id=22">UCLA's website</a>. Or subscribe to <a href="https://www.tarabrach.com/guided-meditations/">Tara Brach's podcast</a> – there you'll find more than a hundred guided meditations.</p>
          <h3 id="apps">Apps & trinkets</h3>
          <p>There are a bunch of mobile apps that provide guided meditations for you. The most popular is called <a href="http://www.headspace.com">Headspace</a>. It's quite expensive, but it is very nice looking and has a lot of helpful content.</p>
          <p>Other options are Calm.com and Buddhify.</p>
          <p>I use an app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meditation-timer-free/id515571863?mt=8">Meditation Timer</a>, which provides me with a nice bell at the beginning and end of each session.</p>
          <p>In the last year, a number of meditation trinkets have popped up in the market. Based on reviews and testing, they are not good enough yet. But in pretty soon, tools like Thync, Spire and Muse Headband will make it easier to meditate with bio-feedback.</p>

        <h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
        <p>Meditation is simple, but it's not easy. In your practice, you'll run in to a couple of challenges.</p>

        <h4>If you find that you don't have the time to meditate.</h4>
        <p>Then it's fine. Perhaps you need <span style="font-style: italic">less</span> stuff to do. Not another thing to keep track of.</p>

        <h4>If you find that you're thinking, constantly.</h4>
        <p>That's OK too. Notice the thoughts, go back to being aware of your breath. You have only failed when you give up. Don't give up.</p>

        <h4>If you spend more time reading about meditation than practicing.</h4>
        <p>Only allow yourself theory after practice.</p>

        <h4>If your back hurts from sitting straight.</h4>
        <p>Stretch for a couple of minutes before each meditation session.</p>

        <h4>If you don't feel more calm and focused.</h4>
        <p>Then perhaps meditation doesn't work for you. Do an experiment with another exercise and compare the results.</p>

        <h4>If you can't find a room for meditation.</h4>
        <p>Then do it wherever. You don't have to shut out the noise. Just listen to it, like you're listening to your breath.</p>

        <h4>If you feel sad / angry / irritated.</h4>
        <p>That's fine. Meditation is not about forcing happiness. It's about being present with what is. Nothing wrong with a li'l sadness.</p>

        <p>-</p>
        <p>The only "real" challenge with meditation is consistency. To keep at it every day for years. That requires prioritization and grit. It also requires that you don't switch methods. If you constantly jump on a new thing, you won’t get the same results as someone who is consistent with a single method.</p>

      <h2 id="books">Book recommendations</h2>
      <p>You need neither books, apps or gadgets to meditate. But if you're like me, you want to understand how the tool works under the hood.</p>
      <p>The best secular books on meditation are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Waking Up by Sam Harris.</li>
        <li>The Mayo Clinic Guide to Stress-Free Living by Dr. Amit Sood.</li>
        <li>Seach Inside Yourself by Chade Meng-Tan.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also find some good meditation techniques in religious scripture from all the world's religions. But there's no need to bother with that if you don't want to.</p>

      <h2 id="styles">Styles of practice</h2>

      <p>Meditation is a latin word, and it means something like contemplation or reflection. There are different kinds of meditation – and we can even make up our own. </p>

      <p>The practice described above is a concentration style of meditation. It helps you get to know your own mind, be more calm and train your focus. </p>

      <p>You could also try doing this meditation practice in action. Try being as present as possible when you are taking a walk, or washing dishes, or lifting weights. Once you notice that your mind is drifting, bring your attention back.</p>

      <p>Another kind of meditation is a philosophical one. You can sit on your own and ponder questions about impermanence, inter-connectedness, or free will. </p>

      <p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation">many other styles of meditation</a>, and I haven’t seen any clear indication that one is superior to another.</p>

      <h2 id="next-level">Next-level practice</h2>
      <p>Once you've done 10 minutes of meditation every day for 30 days, you can go to the next level. If you did it for 26, and not 30 days, start over until you actually have 30 days consecutive training.</p>
      <p>This is important, because continuity is more important than the quality of your practice. You will get results if you're consistent.</p>
      <p>The same pattern is true for all of these goals. There's no need to do a 10-day silent retreat if you're not regularly sitting for 40 minutes every day. There's no rush.</p>
      <h4>Level 2: 20 minutes of meditation every day. </h4><p>Goal: hit 30 consecutive days.</p>
      <h4>Level 3: 40 minutes of meditation every day. </h4><p>Goal: hit 30 consecutive days.</p>
      <h4>Level 4: Try out a 10-day silent retreat. </h4><p>Goal: you've completed a retreat.</p>
      <h4>Level 5: Start a meditation group. </h4> <p>Goal: you meet regularly each week.</p>
      <h4>Level 6: Learn different types of meditation.</h4> <p>Goal: you know the difference between concentration, open awareness, insight, and metta meditation. You can switch awareness objects: breath, words, visualization.</p>
      <h4>Level 7: Learn supporting practices.</h4> <p>Goal: you've mastered breathing exercises that help steady your mind.</p>
